Weather App (ReactJS)
A simple weather app built with ReactJS to fetch and display current weather data for any city using an external API.
This project was part of my effort to learn how to work with APIs and state management in React. I didn’t fully finish it — some things didn’t quite click yet, especially around handling async data and managing components cleanly.
