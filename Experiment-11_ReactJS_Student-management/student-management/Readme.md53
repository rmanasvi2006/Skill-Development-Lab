Student Management App (ReactJS)
This is a basic student management app built using ReactJS. The goal was to create a simple interface for adding, viewing, and managing student data.
I started this project to learn React, but didn't get to fully complete it. There were parts I couldnâ€™t fully wrap my head around at the time, so this remains a work-in-progress and a learning experience.
Feel free to explore or build on it!
